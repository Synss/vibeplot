Welcome to vibeplot's documentation!
====================================

Vibeplot presents a visualization of molecular vibrations in terms of changes
of normal coordinates (bond length, bond angle and bond torsion) in two
dimensions.  The data may be obtained from a vibrational analysis of density
functional calculations (DFT).  Vibeplot is especially targeted at the
chemists.
