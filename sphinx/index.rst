Welcome to vibeplot's documentation!
====================================

Vibeplot presents a new and attractive way to visualize vibrational analysis
from density functional calculations (DFT) in two dimensions. It is especially
targeted at the chemists. The interface can either be scripted or used
interactively with QVibeplot. The idea is to display normal coordinates
(converted displacements of the atoms within the molecule) in terms of changes
of the internal coordinates.

- Bond-length changes (stretching) are indicated by coloring the bonds.
- Angle changes (e.g. like in-plane deformations) are indicated with an arc.
- Torsion changes (e.g. like out-of-plane deformations) are indicated with
  Bezier curves pointing towards the atoms concerned.

In any case, the phase is indicated by the color of the marker, the same color
indicates the same direction for the change.


QVibePlot: the graphical user interface
=======================================

QVibePlot is the graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the :doc:`api`.

Molecules from the free OrbiMol_ database are provided as a quick starter. They
are found in the "File", "OrbiMol DB molecules" menu of the program.

- The top-left pane displays options to tune the display of the image.
- The top-right pane shows the molecule and the visualization.
- The bottom-left pane displays the list of frequencies available for
  the molecule loaded.
- The bottom-right pane represents the spectrum, the currently selected
  vibration is marked in red. (Here, the CN stretch.)


Installation
============

QVibePlot for Windows
---------------------
No installation is necessary for QVibePlot.

Download the latest Windows release from sourceforge_, unzip the archive in an
empty directory and run QVibePlot.exe from there.

Install from sources
--------------------

Download the source from sourceforge_ or clone the git repository

.. code-block:: text

    git://vibeplot.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/vibeplot/vibeplot (read-only)

and run ``python setup.py install`` from the root directory.

That will install both QVibePlot and the vibeplot module.
