- The top-left pane displays options to tune the display of the image.
- The top-right pane shows the molecule and the visualization. (Note
  that the triple bond should be straight, this is a known bug in
  vibeplot.)
- The bottom-left pane displays the list of frequencies available for
  the molecule loaded.
- The bottom-right pane represents the spectrum, the currently selected
  vibration is marked in red. (Here, the CN stretch.)
